  ## Description
  <a name= 'description'></a>
  The employee tracker is designed to maintain the employees of a company. You can view all the departments, roles, and employees each having their own table. With this you can also add any of the following options by choosing to "Add a department", "Add a role", or to "Add an Employee". 

  ## Installation
  <a name= 'installation'></a>
  This project requires the user to install inquirer, express, mysql2 and inquirer. This can be done by typing in the terminal "npm i"

  ## Usage
  <a name= 'usage'></a>
  To use the employee tracker open your terminal and enter "npm i" to install all the needed material. After that, you can begin the program by entering "node server". This will make the prompts appear. The first prompt has 7 options to chose from; "View all departments", "View all roles", "View all employees", "Add a department", "Add a role", "Add an employee" or "Quit". Selecting any of the first will show a table of the corresponding subjects. The department table shows the department name and an id. The role table will show the roles id, title, salary and department the role is in. The employee table shows the employees id, first name, last name, job title, department, salary and the employees manager. By selecting add a department, it prompts you to enter a department name and returns you to the original prompt. By selecting add a role you enter the job title, salary and select a department. By selecting add employee you are prompted for the employees first name, last name, select a job title and select a manager. Finally, the quit option closes the application.
